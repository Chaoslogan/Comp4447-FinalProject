# Comp4447-FinalProject
Final Project - solo - code and other accessory files


Purpose: build a program to quickly find close quality companies to the initially given ticker symbol.  Program finds companies in the same sector and industry and then filters down to close proximity
companies in terms of financials.

files:
finvest.py - main program file
finviz_redo.py - recreation of a portion of the finvizfinance module that needed updating.  Original design is from finvizfinance
final_presentation.ipynb - clean layout of the process with each step giving summary of the data
requirements.txt - module requirements to run the process

Instructions:
1) 'requirements.txt' has the modules needed to run the full program.  Create a new 'venv' environment and run a 'pip install' command to load your venv.
2) make sure all of the files are in the same folder as the .ipynb file before running the Jupyter lab environment.
